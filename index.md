<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a Graduate Research Associate at the **Center for Equitable AI and Machine Learning Systems** and an M.S. candidate in **Advanced Computing** at [Morgan State University](https://www.morgan.edu/), advised by [Prof. Dr. Md Rahman](https://www.morgan.edu/computer-science/faculty-and-staff/md-rahman). My research focuses on building explainable, data-efficient, and multimodal **AI systems** for applications in **medical imaging**, **additive manufacturing**, and **disaster management**.

My current work includes developing generative AI models for defect simulation in 3D scans, fine-tuning large **vision–language models (VLMs)** for clinical captioning, and improving model interpretability in high-stakes domains. I actively contribute to research funded by the **NSF** and the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**.

My research interests include:
- **Multimodal Learning**
- **Vision–Language Models**
- **Explainable AI**
- **Medical Image Analysis**
- **Generative Models (GANs, VAE)**
- **Few-shot and Continual Learning**

Previously, I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/), Bangladesh. I have also worked at **iFarmer Ltd.** as a Data Analyst Intern, building AI-driven document verification and Bengali-language chatbot systems.

In 2024, our team secured **2nd place in caption prediction** and **9th in concept detection** at [ImageCLEFmedical 2024](https://www.imageclef.org/2024/medical/caption), demonstrating the impact of our work in clinical AI.
